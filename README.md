# Useful scripts and configs for my Linux setup at the AIS group

A collection of useful scripts and configs I created.

Known to work with Ubuntu 22.04.

## Usage

1. Download the setup script. Alternatively, you can also copy its content to a new file (mind CRLF conversion!). For example:

```bash
cd ~
sudo apt install wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bertan-karacora/useful-script-and-configs-for-wsl/main/setup
```

2. Make sure to give execution permission using

```bash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

3. Run it.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

4. Cleanup.

```bash
rm ./setup.sh
```
